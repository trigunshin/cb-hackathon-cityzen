The speakers included Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development Adrianne Todman, LA County Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell, and President and CEO of the Los Angeles Urban League, Cynthia Mitchell-Heard.\n\nAccording to Mitchell-Heard, \"The ultimate goal is to eliminate racial disparities and achieve equality and equity by disrupting harmful trends and transforming systems and policies.\"\n\nPer the 2023-2025 State of Black Los Angeles County Report, which is an official report issued by the Los Angeles County Anti-Racism, Diversity, and Inclusion Initiative, close attention was placed to the quality of life of its Black residents.\n\n\"In the second installment of this report, we not only pay attention to the unique challenges that shape Black residents' quality of life in Los Angeles County, we also explore the availability of existing County services aimed at addressing these challenges.\"\n\nThe report continued, \"In addition, we explore how the aforementioned evolving political context have and will continue to shape Black people's experiences in years to come, as well as the lingering effects of COVID-19 on Black communities.\"\n\nThe political context the report refers to is explored in great detail, citing an era of regression ushered in by several Supreme Court decisions as well as attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\n\"Although heavily coordinated efforts to undo the progress made on several measures are nothing new, the last four years mark what appears to be the early stages of an era of regression in which progressive policies are being dismantled and legislative actions that roll back civil, human, and political rights for marginalized populations are being implemented.\" The report warns.\n\n\"These legal and policy reversals weaken laws that protect against discrimination, create a resurgence in discriminatory practices, and deepen social stratification.\"\n\nThe report also cited a one-on-one interview with Mayor Bass in which she indicated that homelessness and the economic divide in Los Angeles County and the most pertinent issues affecting Black Los Angeles.\n\nIndeed, according to the report, Black poverty increases exceeded that of all other ethnic groups, which the report indicated is not a random occurrence. White residents who live in poverty increased by 3.3%, Asian residents in the same situation went up by 4.4%, while Latinx residents poverty increased by 6.1%, and Black residents poverty went up by 7.2%.\n\n\"The racial disparities on the above-mentioned economic outcomes do not occur randomly, rather they are a function of both systemic and interpersonal anti-Black racism that hinders Black people from acquiring (and retaining) employment,\" The report stated.\n\n\"And, when Black people do obtain employment, they are often sorted into the sectors of the labor market that provide less security, lower wages, little to no benefits, and fewer opportunities for career advancement -- minimizing these workers' chances of experiencing upward social mobility.\"\n\nIn its closing sections, the report issued several initiatives for Angeles County to implement. These include adopting a countywide approach to targeted universalism, repairing historic harms and expanding access, and providing mobile services to residents in need.\n\nFurthermore, the report advises residents of Los Angeles County to remain vigilant, and indicated that Los Angeles County will do its part to be steadfast in its anti-racism efforts even as equity based programs elsewhere in the country are uncertain.\n\n\"Angelenos, committed to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, must be vigilant in the face of growing uncertainty about the future of equity-based policies and programs aimed at protecting the rights of and ensuring access to opportunities for all communities, especially Black people in Los Angeles and across the country,\" the report stated.",

Structured by Chan, the bribe \"was shrouded in layers of concealment,\" according to court papers.\n\nThe developer, Wei Huang, was also charged in the case but is considered a fugitive believed to be in China.\n\nChan worked for the city for more than three decades, much of it at the Department of Building and Safety, where he became general manager. In 2016, he was hired by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti to serve as deputy mayor over economic development, supervising the Planning Department, Building and Safety, and other city agencies.\n\nMembers and associates of the scheme included lobbyists, consultants and other city officials and staffers, who sought to personally enrich themselves and their families and associates in exchange for official acts. They included George Esparza, Huizar's former special assistant, real estate development consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim, and lobbyist Morrie Goldman, among others. Each pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation.\n\nBefore Huizar pleaded guilty to federal charges, he and Chan were scheduled to go on trial together. A mistrial was declared in Chan's first trial last year due to a defense attorney's medical emergency.",

Price, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on Bonta's investigation.\n\nAnother South L.A. district, which stretches from Koreatown to the Crenshaw Corridor, has sometimes been referred to as a coalition district. When it was drawn in 2021, one third of its voting-eligible population -- those who are citizens and 18 or older -- was Black. Another third was Latino.\n\nThat district is represented by Councilmember Heather Hutt, who is Black. An aide to Hutt did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Bonta's investigation.\n\nAttorney Dermot Givens, who served on the redistricting commission for the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2012, said he fears that any effort by Bonta to shore up Latino voting strength in one part of the city will weaken Black voter power in another.\n\nEven if the focus is only on the Valley, he predicted there would be repercussions in South Los Angeles, which has the highest concentration of Black voters.\n\n\"No matter what they say, it will have to impact South L.A.,\" Givens said. \"There's no way around that. It just has to.\"",

With that cleared, up, Huizar surrendered to federal prison officials in Lompoc in Santa Barbara County, ready to begin his 13 year sentence at FCI Lompoc II, a low security federal prison.\n\nRepresentatives for Huizar had nothing to say on Monday and Tuesday, with federal prison officials only telling the media that \"Jose Luis Huizar is currently in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Lompoc II.\"\n\nOthers involved in the scandals were also sentenced recently, including former Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan who, because he acted as an intermediary for the pay-to-play scandal, was sentenced to 12 years in prison last week. Only Wei Huang has not been tried, due to him being in China where he is currently a fugitive from justice.\n\n\"Huizar could have been Mayor or a Congressman now if he had not have done that,\" explained Jorge Ramos, a Los Angeles pollster focusing on Hispanic communities, to the Globe on Tuesday. \"He was a school board member, and for 15 years, served on the City Council. For most career politicians, that is a good pedigree to move up. But then he took those bribes and destroyed people's trust in him.\n\n\"So 13 years in jail, or maybe a few years less with good behavior. When he gets out, there is no way he can pick up where he left off. He's done in politics no matter what. There won't be a warm reception when he gets out either. And ask around in his former district. People feel betrayed. They don't want to remember this guy. In fact, a lot of people have said he should have gotten longer.\"\n\nHuizar is currently scheduled to be released in 2037.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

                "text": "José Huizar Due to Begin Prison Sentence - MyNewsLA.com: Disgraced former Los Angeles City Councilman JosÃ© Huizar is expected to surrender to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Monday to begin his 13-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from downtown developers and cheating on his taxes.\n\nHuizar had previously been ordered to self-surrender on Aug. 30, but was granted a five-week continuance for \"good cause.\" Papers filed in federal court show that Huizar based his continuance request on \"a new, unexpected, and extraordinary event,\" apparently connected to undisclosed medical reasons. The government did not object, documents show.\n\nHuizar, 56, pleaded guilty in January 2023 to felony charges of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and tax evasion.\n\nAlong with the 13-year prison term, Huizar was ordered to pay nearly $444,000 in restitution to the city of Los Angeles and almost $39,000 to the Internal Revenue Service. A court filing in February signed by the judge indicates Huizar paid the latter amount in full.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Huizar was not yet listed in the BOP's online inmate locator. His attorney declined comment.\n\nHuizar's co-defendant, former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan, was sentenced on Friday to 12 years in federal prison for acting as the intermediary in Huizar's $1.5 million City Hall pay-to-play scheme with downtown high-rise developers.\n\nChan, 68, of Monterey Park was convicted in March by a jury in Los Angeles federal court of a dozen felony counts: one count of conspiracy to violate the RICO Act, seven counts of honest services wire fraud, three counts of bribery and one count of making false statements to a federal government agency.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Walter ordered him to pay $752,457 in restitution to the city of Los Angeles, and self-surrender to the BOP no later than Jan. 6 to begin his sentence.\n\nHuizar represented Council District 14, which includes downtown Los Angeles and its surrounding communities, from 2005 until his resignation in 2020. According to his lawyers, Huizar was \"an evangelist for robust development\" in efforts to ensure Los Angeles was befitting of a \"world-class city.\"\n\nHuizar admitted to operating a pay-to-play scheme in which he and others unlawfully used his office to give favorable treatment to real estate developers who financed and facilitated cash bribes, campaign donations and other illicit benefits.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Huizar monetized position and leveraged his political clout for over $1.5 million in cash bribes, gambling chips, luxury trips, political contributions, prostitutes, extravagant meals, services, concerts and other gifts.\n\n\"If anyone dared rebuff his call to pay bribes, he punished them and their city projects, threatening developers with indefinitely delayed projects and financial peril,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nChan acted as the intermediary who orchestrated bribes to Huizar from developers, lining his own pockets with at least $750,000 in the process. A letter to the court from the City Attorney's Office said that \"the reputational damage Mr. Chan caused (to local government) is deep and not easily overcome.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors said that while Huizar \"may have been the face of the pay-to-play scheme, (Chan) was the brains that devised some of the most sophisticated aspects\" of the conspiracy.\n\nFor example, Chan arranged what prosecutors called \"the single largest bribe payment obtained in the scheme\" -- the secret funneling of $600,000 from a billionaire real estate developer which Huizar used to confidentially settle a pending sexual harassment lawsuit from a former staffer. Structured by Chan, the bribe \"was shrouded in layers of concealment,\" according to court papers.\n\nThe developer, Wei Huang, was also charged in the case but is considered a fugitive believed to be in China.\n\nChan worked for the city for more than three decades, much of it at the Department of Building and Safety, where he became general manager. In 2016, he was hired by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti to serve as deputy mayor over economic development, supervising the Planning Department, Building and Safety, and other city agencies.",
