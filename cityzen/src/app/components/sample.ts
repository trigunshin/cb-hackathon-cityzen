Another woman, Sarah Alden, 53, was also attacked that night and later died.\n\nPolice later arrested Anthony Francisco Jones, 29; he was charged with two counts of forcible rape, murder, attempted murder, mayhem, torture and sodomy by use of force. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe Times does not normally identify victims of sexual assault, but Klein came forward to share her story, saying people should take it as a wake-up call that more social services are needed for people suffering from mental illness and more police protection is needed for everyone.\n\n\"That's why all this crime is happening -- we're ignoring the extreme mental health crisis going on in our streets,\" she said this summer.\n\nIn filing her claim, Klein said she is trying to drive home the point that the government must do more to protect its citizens. The attack on her, she said, has turned her into an activist for public safety.\n\nLos Angeles City officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the claim.\n\nKlein filmed herself walking up to Los Angeles City Hall on Friday to submit her claim, speaking into the camera as the government buildings loomed behind her. A claim against the city can be a precursor to a lawsuit.\n\n\"There is a dereliction of duty by the government in Los Angeles, in California,\" she says in her video. \"A dereliction of duty to protect its citizens from the criminals and also to fund the police correctly.\"\n\n\"I have lifelong damages to my jaw, my brain, blood clotting in my brain, due to a transient attacking me on an un-patrolled street in Venice,\" she said. The street, she said, \"was dark, no lighting, a public street where numerous incidents of violent crime and murder have occurred, and still absolutely no police presence on the street.\"\n\n\"That's not the police's fault,\" she said. \"That's the people who defund the police.\"\n\nIn an interview, she said she was appreciative of Los Angeles officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, the City Council and the Los Angeles Police Department. She said she supports Bass's goal to expand the LAPD by 1,000 officers.\n\n\"This is not about City Hall,\" she said. \"I see them doing a lot of work to help the community.\" But the government as a whole must do more, she said."

Bass met with hundreds of LAPD officers and community leaders before making her decision.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council still needs to approve the choice.\n\nThe pick ended debate over whether Bass would choose an \"insider\" or \"outsider\" who would shake things up and challenge the way things were done within the department's insular culture.\n\n\"From the beginning, I have been clear: My top priority as mayor is to ensure that Angelenos and our neighborhoods are safer today than yesterday,\" Bass said. \"Chief McDonnell is a leader, an innovator, and a change maker, and I am looking forward to working with him to grow and strengthen LAPD.\"\n\nThe incoming chief will have to make sure the department is ready for the additional security challenges of the 2026 World Cup, 2027 Super Bowl and the 2028 Olympics.\n\nMcDonnell was elected LA County Sheriff in 2014 to oversee the largest sheriff's department in the U.S. Before that, he spent 29 years in the LAPD and served as Long Beach's police chief for almost five years.\n\nMcDonnell vowed to enhance public safety, grow back the force that has shrunk from about 10,000 officers in 2019, and \"ensure respectful and constitutional policing practices.\"\n\nMcDonnell, 65, said he was happy to come out of retirement to do the job.\n\n\"I feel like I still have gas in the tank, fire in the belly, if you will, and a desire to be able to try and be helpful,\" he said.\n\nThe appointment follows the surprise retirement of Chief Michel Moore in early 2024. Moore's tenure was marked by greater scrutiny into excessive force and police killings of civilians in the nation's second-largest city. Dominic Choi has led the department as interim chief -- and the first Asian American chief -- since March 2024. Bass thanked Choi for his work, and said he will continue to serve as assistant chief under McDonnell.\n\nSome had hoped Bass, the first Black woman to be elected mayor in 2022, would use the opportunity to make history and fill the post with the first Latino or female chief. The LAPD has had two Black male chiefs in the past. McDonnell is white.\n\nThe other two candidates sent to Bass, who made the final selection, were Deputy Chief Emada Tingirides, a Black woman, and former Assistant Chief Robert \"Bobby\" Arcos, who is Latino. Both were reported by the Los Angeles Times as finalists for the position.\n\nBass said she has been a champion of inclusion for her whole career.\n\n\"I think there's work that needs to be done in the LAPD,\" Bass said. \"I will continue to pay attention to representation particularly with the Latino population which we know is half of the city of Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe LAPD has faced criticism through the years over its response to the George Floyd protests and several high-profile shootings by officers. It has struggled to get rid of bad cops while also struggling to recruit as more officers who leave its ranks than are coming in.\n\nA report released by Bass last month detailing her meetings with hundreds of officers found low morale to be the top issue within the LAPD, caused by concerns over the fairness of the department's disciplinary process, as well as high stress, \"inadequate\" staffing and \"inconsistent\" support provided after critical events like shootings by officers.\n\nMeetings with community groups emphasized the need for police transparency, focused hate crime reporting, and de-escalation as a means to avoid use of force by officers.\n\nMcDonnell was ultimately a \"safe choice,\" said Fernando Rejón, executive director of the Urban Peace Institute who was among those who met with Bass. He hopes that McDonnell embraces nonpunitive approaches to community safety."

Alexsanian is charged with one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and three counts of concealment money laundering, court papers show.\n\nProsecutors allege Shaklian, often using aliases, managed and submitted claims for seven health care providers enrolled with Medicare and located in Los Angeles County. The businesses included a hospice company she owned and several diagnostic testing companies.\n\nFrom March 2019 to this past August, the companies submitted more than $54 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare for services that were never provided and not needed, and received more than $23 million for those claims, prosecutors contend.\n\nShaklian allegedly laundered Medicare funds by transferring them to accounts in the name of a fake identity.\n\nAlexsanian allegedly directed a foreign national to open a radiology clinic and acquire Medicare provider Console Hospice in Van Nuys, and then provide control of those companies and their bank accounts and the foreign national's personal bank accounts to Alexsanian, prosecutors said.\n\nAlexsanian conspired with the foreign national -- who has since left the country -- and others to have the clinic and Console Hospice submit fraudulent claims to Medicare for services that were never provided, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. They laundered the Medicare reimbursements they received, as well as funds deposited into their accounts through the phony identity, and used them to, among other things, buy more than $6 million in gold bars and coins, prosecutors said.\n\nIf convicted of all charges, Shaklian would face up to 10 years in federal prison for each health care fraud count and up to 20 years for each money laundering count. Alexsanian would face up to 20 years in federal prison for each count, prosecutors noted."

One-third of council members are Latino, while one-fifth -- or 3 out of 15 -- are Black.\n\nCouncilmember Paul Krekorian offered a defense of the 2021 redistricting map last week, saying in a statement that it was \"carefully reviewed\" by lawyers and redistricting experts, who concluded that it was \"fully compliant with the law.\"\n\n\"Not one of the many citizens groups and civic associations who participated in the redistricting process has made any legal challenge to the current [district] maps,\" he said.\n\nBonta, appearing in downtown Los Angeles on Friday to discuss voting rights and the upcoming election, declined to respond to Krekorian's assertions, saying he is bound by confidentiality restrictions. However, he promised that his investigation into the redistricting will be \"fair, thorough and comprehensive.\"\n\nBonta launched the investigation in response to a secretly recorded conversation about the map-making process. On that audio, which was punctuated by crude or racist remarks, De León, two other council members and a high-level labor leader discussed strategies for changing the proposed district maps.\n\nDe León was wounded politically by the scandal, which resulted in the resignation of City Council President Nury Martinez. He now faces an aggressive challenge from tenant rights attorney Ysabel Jurado, who is hoping to become the council's first Filipina American member, representing Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Eagle Rock and other neighborhoods.\n\nJurado, in a news release last week, seized on the news of Bonta's investigation, saying that De León and his colleagues \"actively disenfranchised Latino voters to enrich their own political power.\" At the same time, her campaign said the audio leak scandal showed that De León was \"conspiring to gerrymander districts to dilute Black voting power.\"\n\nDe León, who is of Mexican, Guatemalan and Chinese descent, called Jurado's assertions \"despicable,\" saying he has a lengthy record of fighting for Latinos and underrepresented communities overall. He disputed the idea that he worked to diminish Black voting strength, pointing out that the three districts represented by Black council members were left almost entirely unchanged during the last redistricting.\n\nThe claim that the politicians caught up in the audio leak scandal were working to undermine Black representation has been repeatedly lodged by De León's critics.\n\nPomona College politics professor Sara Sadhwani said Bonta's focus on bolstering Latino voting strength \"blows apart\" that narrative.\n\n\"Those tapes sounded horrible,\" Sadhwani, who served on the state's citizen redistricting commission, said in an interview. \"But at the end of the day, the maps that were approved never disenfranchised Black voters.

He hopes that McDonnell embraces nonpunitive approaches to community safety.\n\nJanel Belovette Jenkins, co-executive director of the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, believes a new chief does not address the \"root issues\" of overpolicing.\n\n\"The LAPD continues to drain resources from the City's budget that could be better spent on housing and jobs -- the true pillars of public safety,\" Jenkins said in a statement.\n\nThe police officers' union, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, applauded the mayor's choice, which confirms her \"commitment to improve historic lows in officer staffing and officer morale and to fix LAPD's broken discipline process,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe union had endorsed Bass's opponent, developer Rick Caruso, in the mayoral race.\n\nJohn Sullivan, who retired as a lieutenant in 2018 after 30 years at the county sheriff's department, called McDonnell a \"hybrid\" insider-outsider.\n\n\"He grew up in the organization, he knows the organization ... but he's also been the chief of a separate department, and he's also been sheriff,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAt the LAPD, McDonnell held every rank from police officer to second-in-command under former LAPD chief Bill Bratton. During that time, he helped implement a federal consent decree imposed on the department largely as a result of the Rampart scandal, a corruption case involving rampant misconduct within the anti-gang unit.\n\nWhen he was elected county sheriff, he inherited a department in the wake of a jail abuse corruption scandal that led to convictions against his predecessor, Lee Baca, and more than 20 other officials. McDonnell was applauded for embracing federal mandates for jail reform, including improving de-escalation training and better documentation of the use of force that has led to improved jail conditions.\n\nIn 2022, he joined the University of Southern California as director of the Safe Communities Institute, which conducts research on public safety solutions.\n\nMcDonnell also served on an advisory committee to USC's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies, a U.S. Homeland Security department-funded institution to do research on counterterrorism, according to Sullivan. His experience with studying international security threats could be an asset as police chief.\n\n\"We have really large public events that are coming that could well be terrorist targets,\" Sullivan said. \"The war in Gaza, the brewing war in south Lebanon, all that's going to have echoes or ripples here in Los Angeles.\""

His leadership will successfully guide and mold the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles and the nation.\"\n\nFormer Asst. Chief Horace Frank praised \"the moral and intellectual caliber\" of McDonnell, saying, \"This is a bold decision by the mayor and she deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nMiriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and a former executive director of the county's Citizens' Commission on Jail Violence, described McDonnell as a \"true public servant,\" someone who has perspectives on law enforcement both as an insider and an outsider.\n\nColumn One is The Times' home for narrative and longform journalism. Here's a great piece from this week:\n\nWhen kindergarten teacher Cynthia Farrow searched for a community where she could raise her family and afford a home with enough space for a few horses, she settled on the sunswept desert town of Littlerock in the Antelope Valley. \"We were priced out of so many places except here in the AV,\" Farrow said, referring to the Antelope Valley. \"It was a dream place and we found a community here. But, sadly, that attracted others here too.\" The affordability, the low population density and the space between homes and properties -- often measured in acres -- are also enticing for correctional authorities and courts across the state looking to relocate former sex offenders who have been conditionally paroled or recently released.\n\nMore great reads\n\nHow can we make this newsletter more useful?

I went over to her house and she listened patiently as I told her how I felt and expressed my certainty that we would marry someday. Susan sat quietly and listened, and with kindness she gently explained that she did not feel the same way. She said that she hoped we could remain friends. Naturally I was crushed but somehow still imagined this was merely a temporary setback."
